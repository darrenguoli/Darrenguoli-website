        Statement
        <br />
         
        <br />
        My research-based practice centers around interdisciplinary scientific and queer thought, rooted in learnings from my undergraduate studies, autotheoretical methods, and computation as experimental apparatus.
        <br />     
                
        <br />
        From an evolutionary and ecological perspective, the human body has become a cybernetic ecosystem, where survival demands our biological systems to adapt to / embed / utilize technological advancements and neoliberal, capitalist, and governmental power structures. Combining computational methods and intuitive creative expression to visually (de)construct and distort the human form is an attempt to represent the dissolved body as both a product of these power structures and a site of resistance to them.  
        <br />
         
        <br />
        My current focus is on the representational entanglement of organic, technological, and digital. Planetary-scale computation (for example, social media, AI) and its cybernetic feedback systems do not only reflect reality, they actively construct it. Has our digital embodiement become an essential component of our physical, biological, physiological, psychological agency and autonomy? I hope to capture a fleeting formfulness that mirrors the relational interweaving of our bodily perceptions—after all, the dissolved body is an armour, (de)constructed and constantly modified to maintain personal agency over external forces.
