            <p><span>A fundamental scientific concept is the function: a mechanism that transforms an input to an output. As an undergraduate at McGill University, my studies of Quantitative Biology demands the use of functions to tackle diverse problems: from proving abstract algebraic claims to deriving the components of a photon’s velocity to analyzing biological data. This academic immersion taught me that beneath the seeming rigidity of equations and theorems exists a creative fluidity that parallels artistic exploration and expression. Scientific ideas and methods can be a powerful tool to inform art and creation.</span>  
                <span>The Color of My Skin In My Own Eyes aims to deconstruct the abstract pieces of my identity and their underlying dynamics through the reconciliation of my subconscious and evolutionary history with my conscious perception of reality. More specifically, it interrogates masculinity and its overlap with femininity (in the traditional sense), its intersection with queerness and race, and its manifestations in movement. Masculinity and the subconscious are inextricably intertwined; the latter is the culmination of hundreds of millions of years of evolution and the former a contemporary expression of it. Here, I use surrealist and stream-of-consciousness principles to visually unravel the multifaceted layers of my subconscious, offering a unique lens through which we can view the interplay between our evolutionary past and present identity and behaviors.</span>
                <span>There is an irony in evolution I hope to capture with these pieces. Dramatic movements of these anthropomorphic male figures within closed spaces reflects the constant societal scrutiny that men face. Whereby evolution, we would instinctually sniff a beautiful flower or delicately twist the stem off a strawberry, today, there is a constant pressure to perform our gender. This project was initially an endeavor in navigating myself as a queer, Chinese man—where my perception of myself and my masculinity were so warped by toxic Western and gay standards.</span>
