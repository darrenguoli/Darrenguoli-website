            <p>A tangentially phallic depiction of closeness as experimentation with charcoal: [Belly; Back and butt; Ankles superimposed]. Here, the grainy, rough, and magnified body maps an emotional human landscape, bearing my identity and self-perceived physicality and positionality. While not quite anatomically accurate, their contours and gradients of texture, light, and recognizability are almost as living matter in motion. There is a reciprocal relationship between the whole and its parts, and the parts are in constant interaction between themselves, the whole, and the space they take.  
                <span>\n</span>
                These pieces were greatly influenced by the Gestalt principle, where the act of perceiving these hyper-zoomed depictions of my anatomy draw the viewer beyond what is on the page into a subconscious effort to understand exactly what they are seeing. This transforms the pieces into an image-person or machine-biology interface, drawing on our biological capacity to perceive.
