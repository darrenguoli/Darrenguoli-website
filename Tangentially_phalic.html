            <p>A tangentially phallic depiction of closeness as experimentation with charcoal: [Belly; Back and butt; Ankles superimposed]. Here, the grainy, rough, and magnified body maps an emotional human landscape, bearing my identity and self-perceived physicality and positionality. While not quite anatomically accurate, their contours and gradients of texture, light, and recognizability are almost as living matter in motion. There is a reciprocal relationship between the whole and its parts, and the parts are in constant interaction between themselves, the whole, and the space they take.  

                These pieces were greatly influenced by the Gestalt principle, where the act of perceiving these hyper-zoomed depictions of my anatomy draw the viewer beyond what is on the page into a subconscious effort to understand exactly what they are seeing. This transforms the pieces into an image-person or machine-biology interface, drawing on our biological capacity to perceive.
